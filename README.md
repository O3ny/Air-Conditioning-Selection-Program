# Air Conditioning Selection Program

**Description**:  
A tool designed to help users select the most suitable air conditioning system based on their specific needs. The program aims to provide accurate recommendations tailored to different conditions to ensure optimal performance and energy efficiency.

### Key Features:

1. **Room Size Analysis**:  
   The program calculates the room size (in square meters) to determine the appropriate air conditioning capacity (BTU) required to cool the space effectively.

2. **Climate Consideration**:  
   It takes into account the local climate (e.g., hot, humid, or dry) to provide recommendations that suit the weather conditions in the region.

3. **Energy Efficiency**:  
   The program considers the energy efficiency ratings of units (e.g., SEER or EER) and recommends units that offer the highest energy efficiency and lower electricity consumption.

4. **Environmental Considerations**:  
   It suggests air conditioning units that use eco-friendly refrigerants and minimize carbon emissions, considering the environmental impact.

5. **User Customization**:  
   Users can input preferences such as budget or brand preferences, and the program will tailor its recommendations based on these factors.

6. **Ease of Use**:  
   The program features a user-friendly interface that allows non-experts to input simple information and receive accurate recommendations.

### Program Objective:
To provide a simple and effective experience for users in selecting the best air conditioning system that offers comfort and minimizes energy consumption according to their individual needs and environmental conditions.
